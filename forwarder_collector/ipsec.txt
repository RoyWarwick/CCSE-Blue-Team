Pre-shared keys
Pros:
    Convenience--no need to go through the complicated process of obtaining a certificate

Cons:

    If a key is compromised, unauthorized access to the network may be obtained
    There are more opportunities to get the key because the it is stored on all the IPsec peer systems
    There is no way to automatically notify the IPsec peers the pre-shared key has been compromised
    Replacing the pre-shared key requires updating it on all systems, which can be tedious
    Pre-shared keys are limited to a maximum size of 64 bytes (512 bits)


Certificates
Pros:

    The key used to generate certificates is stored in a single location, separate from the systems using the certificates
    All systems may be notified of a certificate's compromise via a certificate revocation list (CRL)
    A compromised certificate only needs to be replaced on the system to which the certificate belongs
    The public key embedded in a certificate may be larger than a pre-shared key (1024, 2048, 4096, or more)

Cons:

    Creating/obtaining a certificate is more complicated, time consuming and potentially expensive than using a pre-shared key


TO DO:
put CA certs in vpn directories, ask if x509, configure ipsec settings, change alll key permissions to 600.
